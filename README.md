# Atomic Data Model Builder
AD Model Builder lets you build Atomic Data classes in an intuitive way.

The app was build to explore what would be needed to make an @tomic/react style package for Svelte but turned out to be useful enough to warrant it's own repository.

You can find it here: https://atomicdata-dev.github.io/atomic-data-model-builder/
